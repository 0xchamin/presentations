vision
========

some of the characteristics we want can be addressed with HPC ???

add these to discussion. 
(HPC hels to accellerate long run jobs)

Recommondation/Conclusion 
-- fully fleged system should incoorporate these characteristics 
Vision as a Recommondation 
to reach this vision we need to combine approaches from HPC, spatial data systems, 
(hence this is what researchers should focus on)



Future direction:
- what I want to do in the future ( I want to use HPC for this and DC for aht)
e.g. HPC for inter query parallism, etc. DC for batch processing

what already done, (e.g. lessons learn from spatial data management)

data intensive
compute intensive
vector raster
location query  
feature query
highly scalable
data volume


Final : Requirements for fully fleged ALS 

a fully fleged system should draw from different areas.  and incoorporate these 
characteristics 
  desired requirements for LiDAR data system, 
  in my opinion fully fledged system should have these characteristics
  doesn't exists at the moment, and here it is futuere. 

    querying --> location queries, feature queries, location feature queries, temporal queries,
  multiple indexes
  loading,
  scalable storage,
  concurrent access to large volume of data
  efficient encoding
  derivation of features 
  integration with imagery data
  fusion with imagery data 
  batch processing
  stream processing, 
  data export, 
  feature extraction from LiDAR Data, 
  storage of FWF LiDAR and discrete LiDAR 
  space-based-index 
  object based index
LoD visualization


lessons learn from big systems,
- hardware accelleration,
- adaptor based modular implementaiton
-  
- adoption of open source distributed tools and software

lessons from HPC 
- hpc is mainly suitable for tighly coupled
- compute intensive characteristics can adopt from HPC, 
- query processing also taking a lot of time [parallel filtering]
- point cloud processing already 
- FEATURE derivation, extraction (ML pipeline)



define a broader spectrum of functionalities. 


Tests:
- coregistration

pre-requisites:
co-registration

Introduciton:

Steady evolution of Mapping technology is leading to an increasing availability of multi sensor geospatial datasets
- imaging systems are frequently adopted by mapping community
- LiDAR system 

sophisticated multi-headed frame cameras, line cameras are being used in
imaging systems, 

- improved performance of global navigation satelite system(GNSS),
interial navigation system (INS) technology having a positive impact 

- increased accuracy of direct georeferencing systems leading to widespread 
implementaiton of LiDAR systems for 3D data collection.

The complementary nature of the spectral and spatial data acquired by imaging 
and LiDAR systems is motivating their integration for a better description of 
the object of space. 

A diverse range of spatial data acquisition systems are now available onboard satellite, aerial, and ter- restrial mapping platforms

- imaging systems evolved from single headed cameras to
 multi-headed cameras to pushbroom scanners (line cameras)
- advent of low-cost digital frame cameras ar increasingly being adopted 

- LiDAR scanning: fast and cost effective 3D data acquisition technology 
(LiDAR got tractin with the advent of increased accuracy and affordable GNSS/INS) systems 

characteristics of the acquired spatial and spectral data by passive imaging and
LiDAR systems, one can argue that their integration will be beneficial for an accurate and better description of the object space.
Laser scanning and photogrammetry are powerful 3D data acquisition methods providing both overlapping and complementary information

photogrammetric georeferencing GCP or GNSS/INS 
LiDAR GNSS/INS 


Use-cases of LiDAR and imagery integration: Spatial integration helps these aspects ()
- 3D modeling and reconstruction 
-  recognition and classification of objects 
- generation of photorealistic 3D models 
- automatic classification of landuse
